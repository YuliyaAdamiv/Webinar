I used Koala. Koala is an open source GUI compiler for pre-processing languages. It currently supports Less, Sass, Compass, and CoffeeScript out of the box. It is cross-platform.
## Setup

### To open

- Download/clone from the Github

### To install

1. Create a zip file.
2. Add, to the zip, all files:
   node_mudules
   dust.png
   DustCompiler.js
   LICENSE
   package.js
3. Rename zip to NAME.koala-compiler.
4. Drag-n-Drop NAME.koala-compiler on Koala, and it should install it.

### Add project
Drag and drop a folder into the window to add a project, or click on the plus icon in the top left corner and select your project folder.

### Change output path
By default, the output path is the file directory. If you want to change it, right-click on the file and select "Set output path". You can also click the edit icon near the output path.

Alternatively, you can set the output directory in the project configuration file; please refer to "Using project settings".

Batch file operations: set output path, compile, remove
Select multiple files first, and right-click on them to display the menu.

Use the mouse to select file elements, individually or in a group; ctrl(command) + a to select all.
